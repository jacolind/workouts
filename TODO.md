In the future, I plan to use the “typeform” package to pull the data directly from the web. Then  I can make the python script publish som key metrics directly on jacoblindberg.com/workout Giving out that link to a few friends will create a public commitment to workout, and ask them to harrass me when I haven’t trained. I can also see my key metrics without having to run the script on my computer.

change the script to allow for:
lats, deltoid, spine as well as abs.
this changes the nr of cols, thereby many steps in the script e.g. df.columns = 
as well as he daycategorizer
abs+spine is "core"
